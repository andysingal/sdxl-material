Deforum - System & Setup Info
Deforum is a free AI animation tool that can be run locally as an extension to the Stable Diffusion Web UI, or via our Google Colab Notebook. We also have a node-based system similar to Comfy UI that is still in beta development. Links to our tools can be found here:

Deforum PC System Guidelines:
- GPU: Nvidia RTX 30/40 series with 12Gb - 24Gb VRAM for optimal performance.
(RTX 20 series or cards with less than 12Gb of VRAM will work but will be slower)
- CPU + RAM: Compatible CPU (Intel i5/i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9) with 16Gb+ RAM.
- OS: Windows 11/10 or Linux Distributions
- Storage: SSDs from 2-4Tb. Animations generate gigabytes of data quickly.
Key Points:
- Nvidia GPU with ample VRAM is critical, RTX 30 or 40 series is ideal.
- Sufficient CPU and RAM are also important for performance.
- Windows recommended for community support
- SSD storage is strongly advised due to animation data demands.
- No official support from us for AMD and Mac
AMD GPUs and MacOS
- For best performance PC is king but if you really want to try Deforum with AMD or Mac you can find more info here:
- AMD cards: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Install-and-Run-on-AMD-GPUs
- Mac and Linux installations please refer to the instructions on the Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI GitHub: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
Once you have the WebUI installed you can follow the instructions for installing the deforum extension as outlined in the Windows setup guide.

NOTE: GPUs from AMD and Mac M1/M2 systems are not officially supported but will work at slower speeds. For Apple silicon 32GB of RAM minimum and a Pro, Max or Ultra chip is best but will still have sub-par performance.
